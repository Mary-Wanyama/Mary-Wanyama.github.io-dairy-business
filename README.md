## About The Project
>The projects is built with html and css with some bit of javascript. The site is created essentially for automating the
records and reports of the farm. Both the sales and the production are recorded automatically. The reason for that is to ease
the work of the owner of the land as while maintaining the production. This system offers the most effective dairy farm management system.
